#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.Software engineering can be applied in the technology industry in creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages like Fortran, C.
- The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
- The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Various development methodologies guide the software development process, including:
  - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
    This method is appropriate in a project where the end result is clearly established before starting, and is best suited for projects that require are predictable.
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
    This methodology is best for projects without clear constraints, timelines, or available resources. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
    
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, pycharm).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirements
- Tight Deadlines
- Technical Debt
  Strategies for Overcoming Challenges
 - Effective communication
 - Agile methodologies
 - Prioritization of tasks
 - Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
  
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
- System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control: helps to identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This refers to the process of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Importance of prompt engineering is to avoid vogueness by making statements clear and specific for AI to understand what response is needed.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'Tell me about dogs', this prompt will give a general response.
'Tell me about the history of domestication of dogs' this prompt will be effective because it is clear,concise,complete and correct.
